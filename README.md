Pam Fields

My Project is a pantry organizer, where you can add items to a database,
and once the quantity has been set to 0, will update another table for a
 shopping list.

This project is currently running into several native errors that will
 not allow you to run the program appropriately, and will not update
 the shopping list.

 You will also need to create a database for the pantry for the tables to
  be added to, since I was unable to get these to complete information into
  the repository because the repository will not update further.

  The first table will be for the pantry, with an item and quantity.
  The second table will be for the shopping list, and only needs the item name.

 I was able to get a GUI running, but will not update the program further.
